# 20 React: React Portfolio

Swetha Reddivari

## Description

I used React to develop a webpage for potential employers to sample the work that I created.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, flexbox, media queries, JavaScript, Node JS, React, localStorage, PWA, and MySQL.

## User Story

AS a potential employer/hiring manager
I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples,so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Features of the Portfolio

- Potential employers can view my name, resume, a recent photo, learn about me, view my projects, and contact me via email or LinkedIn
- The UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- When the Portfolio link is clicked the UI scrolls to the section with titled images of my applications
- Users can contact me through an email form in the contact section
- When the application image is clicked the deployed application renders in the browser
